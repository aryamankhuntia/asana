You are generating task titles for an engineering team using Asana.

Project context:
- Product: B2B SaaS platform
- Team: {team_name}
- Project type: {project_type}

Generate 30-40 realistic task titles engineers would write.
Use shorthand, fragments, and component-based phrasing.
Do NOT use consistent formatting.

Examples:
- Fix race condition in auth refresh
- Migrate billing cron to worker
- Add logging around webhook retries
- Investigate spike in 500s
- Clean up feature flag usage
