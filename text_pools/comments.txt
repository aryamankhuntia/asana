Pushed an update, should be good now
Quick ping — any update on this?
I think this is unblocked now
Waiting on confirmation before moving ahead
Added a note in the description
Can someone take a quick look?
This might need a follow-up task
Marking this as ready for review
Blocked until we get access
Syncing with the team on this
I’ll pick this up later today
Left a few comments inline
Do we want this in the current sprint?
Looks fine to me
Minor tweak needed, then good to go
I might be missing some context here
Let’s park this for now
Updated based on earlier feedback
Can we clarify the expected output?
This depends on the previous task
Assigning this back after the changes
We should probably document this
Flagging this as high priority
I’ll handle this once the PR lands
Tested locally, working as expected
Any objections if I close this?
This took longer than expected
Not urgent, but needs attention
Following up from yesterday’s discussion
I think we’re aligned now
Moved this to the correct section
Adding this to my queue
Still seeing the same issue
Can someone double-check the logic?
Closing this out
Let me know if anything else is needed
This can be simplified a bit
All set from my side
